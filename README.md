<h1><code>Overview</code></h1>

> During one of my interviews I was asked to prepare a website simulating a game of battleships between two automated players: so I prepared a simple website allowing the user to observe an ongoing game.

### Summary

Even though the logic behind the game itself is very simplified, lacking any resemblance of AI and missing better reasoning of attacking specific square - right now it's just randomized - I still liked the challenge and the result. The desing is simple, but I enjoyed going throught the idea of using CSS perspective and I think it wouldn't be that hard to develop the game further. 


### What I learned

As I mentioned earlier, it was the first time that I have ever used CSS perspective. Turns out it's not as hard as I thought, but still can look pretty impressive and interesting! 

### Continued development

The logic behind the game itself is very simplified, and if i wanted to take the project further making players attack with more thought put behind it would be first on my list of things to improve.
